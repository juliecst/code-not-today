Hi reader!

Here is the code from my thesis. 

The set up was: There is a dance performance, one audience member is wearing an ANTNeuro mobile EEG cap. Their data was streamed to my computer via pyLSL and then came into touch via OSC. 
The Toe file received an OSC. I extracted a few channels from the signal and used them to inform a simple visual in TD. 

Additionally the other audience members had bleuBallSensors. Their data was sent also via OSC to my computer and saved.
